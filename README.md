# PUBG-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis on PUBG data from Kaggle and predicting whether a player will reach the top 10 roster or not.

Collaborated with: Chrislin Priscilla, Dhivya Swaminathan and Rajeshwari Raji

The main goal of this project is to work with the PUBG (Player Unknownâ€™s Battle Grounds) Match Deaths and
Statistics dataset obtained from https://pubg.op.gg/ and answer the following research questions:

1. Which weapon is more lethal?
For this dataset, through exploratory data analysis, we intend to answer usage of which weapon yielded a
higher kill rate. This is an important question to answer because, based on the type of weapon a player
possesses at that point in a game, his probability of making it to the top 10, or subsequently winning changes.
This analysis can be used to understand patterns of weapon usage and how it influences the player placement
in a game.

2. Predicting whether a player will be placed in the top 10 roster in the game or not
Using this dataset, we intend to predict if a player would survive and make it to the top 10 roster of game or
not. The primary interest behind this is to determine the relationship between the number kills a player
makes, the total distance he covers in the game and the probability of the player making it to the top 10 in the
game. This analysis can be very vital in determining the big question that most PUBG players have: Can I win
the game by just sitting idle, quiet, and staying inside the blue circle? or should I be actively participating in
the game?
